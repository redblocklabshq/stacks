# Red Block Labs - Frontend Work with Stacks (STX) on Bitcoin

Welcome to Red Block Labs, where we design and develop mind-blowing user experiences. As professional frontend architects and UI/UX designers, we used our skills to create user-centered designs and develop them in collaboration with **various projects on Stacks**.
We build high-quality applications on the Stacks blockchain platform. Our team combines strong technical skills with great design to create user-friendly decentralized apps that work seamlessly on Bitcoin.

Our portfolio showcases how we've helped projects in the Stacks ecosystem reach their potential through our frontend development and strategic UX design. Each project represents our commitment to high standards of user experience.

## Zero Authority - Decentralized Freelance Platform

In collaboration with Zero Authority, our team undertook a complete redesign and reimplementation of their frontend platform. We designed and developed a new interface for traditional gigs and bounty-based projects, all powered by smart contracts for trustless execution. We delivered a polished platform featuring real-time analytics UI, secure wallet integration, and UI for automated escrow management. Our reimagined interface helped establish Zero Authority with their upcoming V2 launch.

## BNS.ONE | Bitcoin Name System

**Red Block Labs** designed and developed the official [bns.one](https://bns.one) platform - a decentralized domain name system built on Bitcoin through the Stacks blockchain. Our team created an **intuitive interface** that enables users to easily register and manage human-readable names (like 'satoshi.btc') which serve as digital identities, wallet addresses, and web domains. Similar to DNS for the internet, the implementation of BNS maps readable names to complex Bitcoin addresses and blockchain resources. The live platform features a complete suite of functionality including secure name registration, trading, transfers, and renewals - all powered by blockchain technology to ensure true ownership and uniqueness. **Through our UX design and robust development**, we've made it **seamless** for anyone to participate in the decentralized domain ecosystem by registering and managing their .btc domains through our **user-friendly interface** at [bns.one](https://bns.one).

## BNS Foundation | Community Platform

Our team collaborated closely with BNS to design and develop their community landing page. We created an engaging dark-themed interface featuring animated gradients, interactive elements, and dynamic illustrations. The site effectively presents the BNS ecosystem through a modern hero section and intuitive navigation. Our focus on performance and accessibility ensures a smooth experience for all users, while maintaining a professional look that appeals to both crypto experts and newcomers. This project demonstrates our ability to deliver high-quality, user-focused web platforms.

## DocT | Art Drop Landing Page

Red Block Labs designed and developed an immersive landing page experience for [DocT's](https://x.com/DocT___) groundbreaking "They Are Here" art collection. Leveraging modern web technologies including Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS, we created a visually striking platform that showcases the artist's unique neo-expressionist style and profound narrative works. The landing page features a dynamic gallery interface with smooth transitions and responsive design, allowing visitors to deeply engage with DocT's powerful pieces - from the historic first human brain inscription on Bitcoin to evocative works inspired by their experiences as a pediatrician in conflict zones. Our implementation includes interactive elements that enhance the viewing experience while maintaining the raw emotional impact of the collection, which was featured at the White Night of the Galleries [CryptoArt V4.0] in Craiova, Romania. The minimalist yet engaging design ensures the artwork remains the focal point, inviting viewers to explore and reflect on DocT's intimate explorations of endurance, memory, and the human condition.
